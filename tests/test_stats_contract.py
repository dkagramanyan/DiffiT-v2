"""The row this repo writes to ``stats.jsonl`` must be readable by combra.

``combra.metrics.load_fid_by_kimg`` reads ``Metrics/combra_fid`` and
``Progress/kimg`` from the same JSON line, and shape-filters away any record whose
values are not plain scalars -- silently, returning ``{}``. That is exactly how
san-v2 and StyleSwin runs produced an unreadable metric history while every
combra-side test passed: the reader was tested against a synthetic *flat* row, and
nothing tested the producer.

This is the producer half. It builds the real row through the training loop's own
function, so a change to the row shape fails here instead of silently emptying the
analysis layer.
